partition
=================
dividing single hardisk into multiple logical drives


why do we need partiton
=============================
in case of system failure you have reinstall the os if u reinstall all the data will lost 
so it is better to keep a partition disk to store your data separately,so whenever you reinstall your os 
your data will be untouched
2 organising the data properly
3to work on multiple os
4chances to use multiple filesystem
5limit our data growth

disk partition sheme
======================
mbr                                                              gpt
ibm 1980                                                    intel-2007
masterboot rector                                            you create here maximum 128 primary partition
 it will stored under 1st sector                             your hardisk will support in zetta bytes

of the hard disk
512bytes
446bytes------boot loader information
64bytes---------partition table information
2bytes------------mbr validation check 
only 3 primary partition can be created
hardisk will support upto 2tb


the criteria of disk partition
==============================
primary partition
======================
it is a partition the bios will recognize while booting,os can be installed and os related info will be stored under 
this partition
extended partition
======================
it is a partition the bios will not recognize while booting no os related or os cant be installed in this partition
logical partition
====================
logical partition is created from your extended partition

disk identification
======================
ide-(integrated disk electronic)---/dev/hda
scsi-(small computer system interface)---/dev/sda
virtual-/dev/vda


the method for creating partition
===================================
fdisk--------it will not allow partition more than 2 tb
gdisk-------it will allow you for creating more than 2tb of partition
parted

file system
=================
it is the method of storing the data in an organised fashion

the oldest method for creating a filesystem is

#mkfs -t <f/s>  <devicepoint>
or
#mkfs.<f/s> <device point>
         xfs  /dev/sdb1
types of file system
======================
ext2
ext3
ext4
xfs
features               ext2               ext3               ext4               xfs
journaling              X                 yes                  yes              yes
invented                 1993            2001                  2008             2002
max file size             2Tb            2Tb                  16Tb              2Eb
max file system size       32Tb           32Tb                1Eb              8Eb
max directories            32000        32000                 64000          more than 64000


creating a partition
======================
#lsblk -----list the block
fdisk /dev/sdb
:m(help)
:n(new partition)
:enter (default primary)
:enter(1st sector or start)
:last sector :+1G
:p
:w

#partprobe /dev/sdb1
updating to the kernel
 #mkfs -t xfs /dev/sdb1
command to create a filesystem

#blkid
command to check the uuid of the partition
#mkdir /root/d1
creating a directory for mounting it
#mount /dev/sdb1  /root/d1
temporary mounting
#df -Th
to check the file system information
#umount /dev/sdb1
unmounting the filesystem
#vim /etc/fstab
<device point>  <mount point>  <f/s>  defaults 0 0
                                               (dump) (fsck)
#mount -a
it will list all the entry point which is there in the fstab file

#df -Th
